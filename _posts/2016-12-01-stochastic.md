An alert or set-up is present when the %D line is in an extreme area and diverging from the price action. The actual signal takes place when the D line is crossed by the faster K line.

**It works best for short duration trading, weekly or daily trading.**

**The RSI line is less volatile and reaches extremes less frequently than stochastics. The best signals occur when both oscillators are in overbought or oversold territory.**

TODO: Divergence in Stochastic ??

In the early stages of a new trend, following an important breakout, oscillators often reach extremes very quickly and stay there for awhile. Basic trend analysiS should be the main consideration at such times, with oscillators given a lesser role. Later on, as the trend begins to mature, the oscillator should be given greater weight.

Signals on weekly charts are always more important than those on daily charts. The best way to combine them is to use weekly signals to determine market direction and the daily signals to fine-tune entry and exit pOints. A daily signal is followed only when it agrees with the weekly signal. Used in that fashion, the weekly signals become trend filters for daily signals. That prevents using daily signals to trade against the prevailing trend.
