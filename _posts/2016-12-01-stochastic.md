An alert or set-up is present when the %D line is in an extreme area and diverging from the price action. The actual signal takes place when the D line is crossed by the faster K line.

**It works best for short duration trading, weekly or daily trading.**

**The RSI line is less volatile and reaches extremes less frequently than stochastics. The best signals occur when both oscillators are in overbought or oversold territory.**
