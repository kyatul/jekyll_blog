Whenever you decide to buy, ensure that the volumes are substantial. This means that you are buying along with the smart money.

**So what does an increase in price, associated by decreasing volumes indicate?**
It means the price is increasing because of a small retail participation and not really smart-money.

A decrease in price indicates that market participants are selling the stock. Increase in volumes
indicates the presence of smart money. Both events occurring together (decrease in price + increase
in volumes) should imply that smart money is selling stocks.
