It is a leading indicator.

Oscillators helps us to find `over-bought` and `over-sold` conditions. when the oscillator reaches an extreme value in either the upper or lower end of the band, this suggests that the current price move may have gone too far too fast and is due for a correction or consolidation of some type.

**10 day time period line is mostly used.**

If prices are rising and the momentum line is above the zero line and rising, this means the uptrend is accelerating. If the up-slanting momentum line begins to flatten out, this means that the new gains being achieved by the latest closes are the same as the gains 10 days earlier. While prices may still be advancing, the rate of ascent (or the velocity) has leveled off. When the momentum line begins to drop toward the zero line, the uptrend in prices is still in force, but at a decelerating rate. The uptrend is losing momentum.

**Oscillator analysis should not be used as an excuse to trade against the prevailing market trend**

Moving Average crossover is spotted when oscillator comes at zero line.If the shorter average is above the longer, the oscillator would be positive. A negative reading would be present if the shorter average were under the longer.

When the two moving average lines move too far apart, a market extreme is created calling for a pause in the trend.Very often, the trend remains stalled until the shorter average line moves back to the longer.
