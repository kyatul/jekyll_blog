1. The stock should form a recognizable candlestick pattern
  a. Note: We have learnt some of the popular patterns in this module. To begin with you can use    just these patterns to comply with checklist
2. S&R should confirm to the trade.The stoploss price should be around S&R
  a. For a long trade, the low of the pattern should be around the support
  b. For a short trade, the high of the pattern should be around the resistance
3. Volumes should confirm to the trade
  a. Presence of above average volumes on both buy and sell day
  b. Low volumes are not encouraging and hence do feel free to hesitate taking a trade where the volumes are low
4. Look at the trade from the Dow Theory perspective.
  a. Primary, secondary trends

**If the indicators confirm, I increase the bet size, if they donâ€™t, I still go ahead with my original game plan.**

5.Indicators should confirm
  a. Scale the trade size higher if indicators confirm to your plan of action
  b. If the indicators do not confirm go ahead with the original plan
6.RRR should be satisfactory
  a. Think about your risk appetite and identify your RRR threshold
  b. For a complete beginner, I would suggest the RRR to be as high as possible as this provides a margin of safety.
