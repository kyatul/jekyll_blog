As the second word says, Moving Average is the average of the closing price of stocks for a particular time period.

Moving Average is a trend following devise.It tells whether a trend has started.It never anticipates; it only reacts. The moving average follows a market and tells us that a trend has begun, but only after the fact.

**Buy/Sell Signals**
When the closing price moves above the moving average, a buy signal is generated. A sell signal is given when prices move below the moving average.

For added confirmation, wait till moving average line itself turn in the direction of the price crossing.

**200 MA**
A 200 MA is most used Moving Average, and it gives a general idea about the company. During an uptrend it acts as support and during a downtrend it acts as resistance.

**Simple Moving Average vs Exponential Moving Average**
SMA shows a lag with respect to change in the market, whereas EMA quickly adapts to the change in the market as it gives higher priority to the latest trades.

**Draw two EMA of 13 and 62 period for IntraDay Trading. Watch for a crossover and then a little dip/support in uptrend.**

**Double Crossover**
Two MA lines are created of 5/20 days or 10/50 days and the crossover signals the buy/sell. The fast moving average line should be above for a buy signal and vice-versa.

**Triple Crossover**
Three MA lines are created of 4-9-18 days. Line-4 above Line-9, and Line-9 above Line-18 gives a Buy Signal and vice-versa.

**MA Lines Value**
Taking 5 as initial, and keep doubling it i.e 5,10,20,40 so that cycle principle is followed.
