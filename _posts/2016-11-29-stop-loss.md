`Swing-High` is also known as `Resistance`.
`Swing-Low` is also known as `Support`.

**Buy Signal**
Its a `Buy` signal whenever,market breaks the swing-high. A swing-high break on daily-time-frame means a lot of enthusiasm from large bullish investors. We are following the money.

Buy slightly high than the 'swing-high'

**Sell Signal**
The closest `support/swing-low` after making a buy works as our stoploss. Stoploss is an automated trading feature to sell our stocks when it decreases to a particular value.

Keep increasing the stoploss value, as the new and higher `swing-low` are getting created.

**Position Sizing**

Position Sizing implies how many shares to buy depending on your capital keeping risk in mind.

If your capital is 1 lakh ruppees, you should not loose more than 1% in a single trade. That is not more than Rs. 1000.

To put in simple terms it is the amount of loss that you can bear in a single trade.
