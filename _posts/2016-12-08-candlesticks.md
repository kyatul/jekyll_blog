A single candle depics daily open,close,high and low price.

A white body means that the close price was greater (higher) than the open price, and vice-versa for the closed body.

The open and close prices are given much significance in Japanese candlesticks.The small lines above and below the body are referred to as wicks or hairs or shadows,they represent the high and low prices for the day and are normally not considered vital in the analysis by the Japanese.

Days in which the difference between the open and close prices is great are called **Long Days**. Likewise, days in which the difference between the open and close price is small, are called **Short Days**.

**Spinning Tops** are days in which the candlesticks have small bodies with upper and lower shadows that are of greater length than that of the body.The body color is relatively unimportant in spinning top candlesticks. These candlesticks are considered as days of indecision.

When the open price and the close price are equal, they are called **Doji lines**.

**Classification of Doji Lines**
The **Long-legged Doji** has long upper and lower shadows and reflects considerable **indecision** on the part of market participants.

The **Gravestone Doji** has only a long upper shadow and no lower shadow. The longer the upper shadow, the more **bearish** the interpretation.

The **Dragonfly Doji** is the opposite of the **Gravestone DOji**, the lower shadow is long and there is no upper shadow. It is usually considered quite **bullish**.

**Candle Pattern** A Japanese candle pattern can consist of a single candlestick line or be a combination of multiple lines, normally never more than five.

**You must determine the trend, before you can utilize Japanese candle patterns effectively.Once the short term (ten periods or so) trend has been determined, Japanese candle patterns will significantly assist in identifying the reversal of that trend.**


**Candle patterns are considered only when O/OD is in its pre signal area, that is above 80 or below 20.**
